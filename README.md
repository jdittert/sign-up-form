# sign-up-form
This is the mock sign-up form from the Odin Project, found here [TOP Sign Up Form](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).

The skills used in this project include basic html, basic css, selecting children of divs, setting css variables, form styling, and client-side form validation. 

Instead of designing my own graphics, color schemes, etc. for the form, I copied the example as closely as I could. I assume this mirrors what would occur on an actual job.
